# Parental Involvement

<span></span>
At Covenant Classical School, we desire to assist and support parents in the education of their children, and likewise encourage families to be as active as they can be in the life of the school.  We provide regular continuing education opportunities for parents to go deeper in their understanding of classical learning.  Our goal is not only to enrich the adults but also to forge stronger relationships between the school and parents.

There are also regular fellowship opportunities for parents throughout the school year and several family events to help build community within the school.

There are many opportunities for parents to serve as volunteers in the school, including:

*   Serving as room parents.
*   Serving as lunch monitors.
*   Chaperoning field trips.
*   Presenting your vocation to the class or hosting a field trip to your place of business as it may relate to an area of study in a class.
*   Sharing your experiences, trips, vacations, as they may relate to an area of study in a class.
*   Joining a fundraising team or other school committee.
