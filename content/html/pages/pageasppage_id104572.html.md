# Logic

<span>Logic is the skill of correct thinking and conceptual development.  It is the thinking through of similarities, comparisons, and differences in order to induce the correct general conclusions.  Studying logic and practicing logical thinking prepares students for the development of wisdom.  Unfortunately, logic is all but forgotten in modern schools. 

During the Logic Stage (Grades 6-8), students study the various types of logic including informal logic, categorical logic and symbolic logic.  Logic has a central place in our Logic Stage curriculum in that it is a subject and skill that is applied and used in virtually every other class.   For example, students in history, literature or science classes are required to think logically about the content they study and to respectfully expose any fallacies they detect in texts, presentations, or discussions.  Their writing in these classes is assessed for logical sharpness, and examinations presuppose and exercise logical skill.  These skills in logic are also foundational for more extensive studies in the Rhetoric Stage (Grades 9-12).</span> ![](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/classicaleducationschool-W(1).jpg)
