Observe, Interpret, Apply...Repeat!</span>**_**<span></span>**

Written by Stephanie Cavin, Upper School Girls Bible Study leader and Covenant parent_

This year I have been blessed with the opportunity to lead an after-school Bible study for the Upper School girls. We are studying the life of Joseph using the inductive Bible study method. What makes this method unique is that the primary focus is on the biblical text itself, and the girls are learning (using observation, interpretation, and application) how to decipher, correctly assess, and have a deeper understanding of God’s word. In other words, they are learning to study the Bible for themselves!

The Lord laid this particular study on my heart as I was praying through a difficult time in my family’s life. As I struggled to persevere and felt like I was fighting for joy, I was reminded of James 1:2-4, where James says to “count it all joy, my brothers, _when_ you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.” <span></span> I knew I had a decision to make. I was either going to run to the “arm of flesh” <span></span> for comfort and encouragement, or I was going to surrender my suffering into the hands of a Sovereign God.

As I consider the world these girls are growing up in, and how they will be faced with the very same decision, my sincere prayer for them is that the Lord would move mightily in their lives. That they would be forever changed, not because of a small after-school Bible study, but because of the power that radiates from the study of God’s word.
