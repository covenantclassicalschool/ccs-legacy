# Logic School

 <span>**<span>Logic Stage (6th Grade - 8th</span> **<span>Grade)</span>****</span> 

During the Logic School years, the student expands on the knowledge acquired during the grammar years.  At this level, the student possesses a greater ability to analyze causal connections and relationships between facts. Here teaching methods shift from songs and chants to discussion, debate, and argument.  Students continue to make use of the "tools" that they acquired in Grammar School, but the emphasis becomes the new dialectic tools. Students are taught socratically with a good deal of give and take between teacher and students.  The classroom environment fosters inquiry, discussion, and debate, with an emphasis on reason and analysis.

Logic, the skill of clear thinking and conceptual development, has a central place in the curriculum.  Students have three years of logic classes in which they learn the principles of valid reasoning and acquire the ability to discern argumentative fallacies.  Students are not to leave logic in Logic class, though.  They are expected to apply it across the curriculum in their other classes.  For example, students in history, literature or science classes are required to think logically about the content they study and to respectfully expose any fallacies they detect in texts and in presentations.  Writing assignments in these classes are assessed for style and quality of argumentation.  Students learn to think clearly, to analyze, and to synthesize information across subject areas.
