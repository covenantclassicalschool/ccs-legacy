# Service Opportunities

At Covenant, we desire that students develop a passion for serving others.  In addition to curricular opportunities, we provide numerous opportunities for students to serve and to develop leadership skills.

Our Upper School students participate in a "House System" that provides students opportunities to lead the planning and implementation of service projects.  Recent service projects have included:

*   Afternoon of serving at _Feed My Starving Chidren_
*   Talent show to raise funds for local and global missions
*   Visits to area nursing homes

Upper School students also assist in the promotion of all-school events designed to build community among school families.![](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/service-opportunities.jpg)
