**<span>STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES</span>** 

Our 1st through 8th grades take the Iowa Test of Basic Skills each year.  The Iowa Test assesses student progress in key academic areas.  The chart below shows Covenant's scores for the 2014 Iowa Test for the “Percentile Rank of Average Standard Scores: National School Norms”.  This score compares the average score of each class at Covenant with the average scores of classes at the same grade level in the nation.  _<span>As shown in the chart, the average Core Total and average Composite scores of each Covenant class were higher than the average Core Total and average Composite scores of 96% or greater of classes at the same grade level in the nation.</span>_

 **<span>NATIONAL LATIN EXAM RESULTS</span>**

Covenant’s Upper School students participated in the National Latin Exam in March 201\.  Sponsored each year by the American Classical League and the National Junior Classical League, the exam is taken by over 150,000 students from the U.S. and twelve other countries. The majority of students taking the National Latin Exam are in high school, since that is when many students begin their study of Latin.  A smaller number of middle school and college students also take the exam.

Covenant's 6th grade students took the _Introduction to Latin_ exam, which assumes knowledge equivalent to high school introductory Latin courses.  Two students in the class received ribbons for scores in the highest "Outstanding" category. Over half of our 6th grade students earned certificates for receiving scores above the average national score. 

<span>Covenant's 7th and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students took the _Latin I_  and _Latin II_  exams, respectively, which assume knowledge equivalent to intermediate high school Latin courses.  Covenant students performed exceptionally well on the exams: one student received a gold medal, three students received silver medals, and one student received a Cum Laude certificate.</span>

<span>Congratulations to Mr. Spice for his excellent leadership of our Logic School Latin program and to  our students for their dedication to their Latin studies.</span>
