# All We Ever Wanted

**<span>My Story</span>** _**<span></span>** by Katy Ivy, Covenant parent_

Late last spring my husband and I felt led to look at some different schools from where our daughter was attending first grade.  Throughout the year we had growing concerns about her schooling from a social, academic, and spiritual perspective.  The thought of sending her to a new school, though—one that was no longer in our subdivision—was scary for us.   While we knew the Lord would help guide us in this decision, we also knew it would require a large amount of faith. 

We began our search for a school that would provide her with a smaller class size, as well as an institution dedicated to seeing her flourish academically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually.  It was a daunting process. We wondered how we’d afford it and how our daughter would feel with the landscape of her daily life altered.

A verse we turned to during this process was Proverbs 3:5-6: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”  

After visiting many different schools and asking the Lord for direction, it became clear that Covenant was the best fit for our daughter.  The community at Covenant is second to none.  People welcome you with open arms, ask questions of you, and truly care about you.   Above all else, Covenant cares about our daughter’s character. The teachers and staff are dedicated to helping her grow and thrive on all levels--academically, socially, and spiritually. In just a few months, her teacher has become keenly aware of who our child is and how she’s progressing.   Not only is our daughter receiving a strong academic foundation, she is growing as a child both socially and spiritually.  From a social perspective, we love how older children help mentor and play with the younger children and that she is learning how to interact with children of all ages.  We also love how our daughter is not only learning about the Bible but also how to apply it in all areas of her life.  We feel our daughter is being provided with such a well-rounded educational experience at Covenant which was exactly what we were looking for.

However, while we absolutely LOVE Covenant, nothing is more important than knowing our daughter loves it.  Our worry about whether our daughter would miss her old school quickly dissipated when we heard her response to an administrator who asked how she liked Covenant.  From the mouth of our second-grade girl: “I LOVE it!  It’s everything I have ever wanted in a school.”  God is always faithful, and was in this case as well.  

That sunny spring day, when we felt led to make a change in our daughter's school experience and unsure of what to do, has morphed into something beyond our imagination.  The decision to move our daughter to Covenant was the best decision we could've made.  God truly is faithful even when we don’t know how his plan is going to unfold.   Thank you, Covenant, for being all that we, too, have ever wanted in a school!
