# Art

Students are encouraged to appreciate and imitate the beauty of God's creation through art.  Students are taught to use a variety of art media and are taught the basic fundamentals of drawing to enable them to create adequate renderings.   A subset of the students' art projects are integrated with the historical period that the students are studying to further reinforce these studies.  

Students observe great artwork, learn about the history of the works and the relationship between art and culture, and describe and discuss their opinions of the works.  They also learn by imitating the great works they have observed as they begin to develop their own creativity and self-expression. Students are encouraged to express themselves artistically in a manner that honors God.
