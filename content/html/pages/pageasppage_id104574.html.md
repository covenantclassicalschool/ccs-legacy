# Physical Education

Students are encouraged to recognize that their bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and, in cooperation with parents, are encouraged to knowledgeably establish and maintain good health and nutritional habits.  Students are taught basic exercises and the benefits that these exercises provide for various body systems, as well as the function of different muscles and how to strengthen them.  Instruction is provided in basic game skills such as throwing, hitting, kicking, and catching, helping students to improve coordination, agility, strength, and endurance.  Biblical patterns of behavior are encouraged through activities requiring cooperation, team work, and good sportsmanship in competitive situations.![](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/phyed-W.jpg)
