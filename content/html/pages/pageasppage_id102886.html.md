# Grammar School Read Alouds

<span>_A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way, and it takes every word in the story to say what the meaning is. You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate._  
Flannery O’Connor

Why do our teachers read aloud to students?
•    To introduce your children to great literature that is beyond their personal reading ability.
•    To help your children develop a life-long love of reading.
•    To expand your children's vocabulary.
•    To build listening skills, including the ability to visualize the meaning of spoken words.
•    To develop oral reading skills.</span>  **<span>Covenant Classical School  Read Aloud Stories</span>**
