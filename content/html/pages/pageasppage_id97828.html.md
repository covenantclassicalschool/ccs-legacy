**Need-based discounts:**  Additional information on this program is available on our <span></span> <span></span>[<span>N</span> <span>eed-Based Tuition Discounts</span> <span></span> ](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/pages/page.asp?page_id=97829) page.**Referral discounts:**  We hope that Covenant families will be excited to tell others about the school.  As an additional incentive to share Covenant with others, we are offering a 10% discount off of one year of tuition up to a maximum of $1000 to families who bring a new family to Covenant.  The new family must not be currently enrolled in a classical Christian school.  The tuition discount will be effective for a family after the new family they have brought to Covenant has enrolled in the school.</span>![](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/tuition-W.jpg)
