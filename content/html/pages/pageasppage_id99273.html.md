 <span><span>**Gifts of Cash**</span> Cash gifts may be given in the form of a check. You may also designate a recurring gift to be given on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis.

The tax code generally favors this form of giving.  Giving an asset to Covenant Classical School, then allowing Covenant to sell it, eliminates potential capital gains taxes and can increase the after tax proceeds.

How Does the Tax Benefit Work?
_Itemized Deduction:_  Generally, an individual or business is allowed to deduct the fair market value of appreciated capital gain property as a charitable contribution if held at least one year.

_Capital Gains:_ The transfer of capital gain property to the not-for-profit (Covenant) does not generate capital gains tax.  The not-for-profit (Covenant), as a tax-exempt entity, realizes the full market value at the time of sale, less transaction costs, without paying any taxes_._</span>  <span>**<span>Matching Gifts</span>** You can double the impact of your giving through your employer's Matching Gift Program!

Companies that offer matching gift programs to eligible schools/charities can double the effect of their employee's generosity.  To double your impact of giving to education through Covenant, ask your company's HR department if it sponsors a matching gift program.  If it does, request their enrollment form, and send the completed form to:

**Covenant Classical School**

1852 95th Street
