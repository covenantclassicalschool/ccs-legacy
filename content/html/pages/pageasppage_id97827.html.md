# Enrollment Application Process

<span></span>[](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/CovenantTeacherEvalEnglish2015.pdf)At Covenant, we believe that students are best served when the school and home share a common educational philosophy and common educational goals.  This is why we attempt to give prospective parents a full understanding of who we are, what we believe, and what we do.  Our admission process is designed to help you learn more about Covenant and to help Covenant learn more about you and your child so that a determination can be made as to whether Covenant is a good fit for your child.

Our admission process is described below.  We are currently accepting applications for the 2016-2017 school year. 

Student applications are due by March 1, 2016\.  For any applications received after March 1, 2016, admissions decisions will be made on a rolling basis for grades in which openings remain.  For grades without openings, parents will be given the opportunity to place their students on a waiting list.

Please note that a child must be five years of age by September 1, 2016 to apply for our Kindergarten class.

_Please note that Teacher Evaluations and transcripts must be received by Covenant for your application to be complete._

_After the Admission Committee has reviewed your complete application, we will contact you to schedule Admission Testing._

 <span>**4.**</span> **<span>Complete Admission Testing</span>  **

Admission testing is designed to determine if your child can be well served by Covenant, to determine grade placement, and to determine if there are any needs for tutoring prior to entrance into Covenant.

_After admission testing is completed, we will contact you to schedule an admission interview._

We request that parents read the booklet <span>_[<span>An Introduction to Classical Education</span>](http://classicalsubjects.com/resources/ICE.pdf)_</span> by C. A. Perrin prior to the interview.  A copy of this booklet is included as part of our information folder.  If you do not have a copy, please print a copy using the link above or contact our school office to obtain a copy.  Concepts covered in this booklet will be discussed during the interview, so it is very important that parents read the complete booklet prior to the interview.

<span>**5.**</span> **<span>Complete Admission Interview</span>  **
The admission interview is an opportunity for you to meet with the Head of School and members of the Admission Committee so that we can get to know you, and you can ask questions or express any concerns.  Both parents are requested to participate in this one-hour interview, and applicants to our Logic (6th-8th) and Rhetoric (9th - 11th) levels may be requested to join their parents for the interview.

_Within one week of the Admission Interview, we will contact you with the admission decision._

If a student is admitted, he will be placed in the grade for which he is applying if his previous school work and admission testing results indicate that he is prepared to enter that grade. If through admission testing results or other evidence, it is determined that the child is not adequately prepared for the grade for which he is applying, it may be necessary that he repeat the previous grade. 

Regardless of whether the student is admitted to the grade for which he is applying or to the previous grade, it may be the case that tutoring will be required prior to the start of the school year, and in some cases, continuing during the school year.  Unless a student has been previously school classically, tutoring is likely to be required in English grammar and writing, as well as in Latin.  This tutoring is not included in the standard tuition.  If needed, details on tutoring fees will be provided by the Admission Committee at the time of acceptance.

<span>**6.**</span> <span>**Secure Admission**</span> 
If a student is admitted, an acceptance letter will be mailed to the parents, with a request to sign and return the Parental Covenant within two weeks, with a non-refundable deposit of $500 to secure enrollment.
