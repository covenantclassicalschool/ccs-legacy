# Uniform Policy

 <span>We uphold standards in dress and grooming because we seek to cultivate an atmosphere of order and unity that is conducive to learning.  We believe that genuine diversity comes not from dress and grooming, but from the cultivation of each student's unique mind and character.  Our uniform policy encourages standards of dress and appearance that reflect the appropriate tone of school life.

Uniforms are beneficial for many reasons, including:</span> 

*   <span>Uniforms encourage modesty and neatness.</span>
*   <span>Uniforms are cost-effective.  (A uniform resale is held at the end of each school year.)</span>
*   <span>Uniforms help parents by eliminating any disagreements over what to wear to school, and promoting time efficiency and organization through simplicity.</span>
*   <span>Students in uniform focus more on their studies than their clothes.</span>
*   <span>When uniforms are worn, the atmosphere in the classroom is calmer, more polite, and more attentive.</span>
*   <span>When uniforms are worn, students find ways to express themselves creatively through the arts, music, personality and academic achievement, rather than through their clothes.</span>
*   <span>Uniforms minimize economic differences.</span>
*   <span>Uniforms help to make students easily identifiable.</span>

<span>All students should present themselves with an appearance that does not draw undue attention to one’s self and is characterized as clean, modest and professional.</span> <span>To achieve the benefits of a uniform policy, the policy needs to be enforced by the school administration.  Therefore, if a student is wearing an item that is not one of the uniform options, a note will be sent home to the parents.  The standards of dress and grooming provided within the policy are not exhaustive; all dress and grooming is subject to the judgment of the administration.</span>  <span></span> 

Uniform items may be ordered from Lands’ End by selecting the “Shop” link below or by calling Lands’ Ends at **800-963-4816** .<span> </span>  Our Preferred School Number is 900137639\. Lands’ End items are also available at Sears.

It is important that each child’s name be printed in indelible ink on all P.E. articles, sweaters, and fleece jackets, since so much of this clothing is identical throughout the student body.
