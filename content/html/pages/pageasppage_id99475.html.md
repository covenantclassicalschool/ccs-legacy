# About Covenant

<span>**<span>WELCOME TO COVENANT CLASSICAL SCHOOL</span>** Covenant Classical School is a private, coeducational, classical Christian school in Naperville, Illinois, serving families in the western suburbs of Chicago.  We are excited about your interest in classical Christian education and hope that you will find our web site helpful in learning more about Covenant.

Rather than simply filling students’ minds with facts, we go further at Covenant to develop a student’s ability to think, reason, read, write, and speak well. For the student at Covenant, all subjects, from math to Latin to art, are mutually integrated and bound up in the life of faith. Through the integration of life and faith, students develop a thoroughgoing Christian worldview–and then live it out!  A classical Christian education is a powerful tool for instilling a solid Christian world view in the next generation, tomorrow’s leaders. We teach with the next generation in our minds and its mission field in our hearts.

<span>Covenant desires to be a school which reflects the larger Christian community.  Provision of tuition discounts to families who are in financial need allows the school to have a broad socio-economic representation of families and to include students whose families could not otherwise provide a classical Christian education for their children. Covenant employs the independent company FACTS to provide a third party assessment of all applications for tuition discounts. Applicants who demonstrate financial need, as determined by FACTS, will be considered for tuition discounts by the Covenant Board of Trustees.</span>
<span></span> <span></span> **DIVERSITY**

<span>Covenant is blessed with diversity in its faculty and families.  Over 35% of Covenant students are of African American, Asian, or Hispanic descent. Many churches (denominational and non-denominational) are represented.  Covenant's need-based tuition discount program provides for a broad range of economic diversity as well.</span>  <span></span> <span></span></span><span>NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY</span>

<span>Covenant Classical School admits students of any gender, race, color, nationality, or ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students in the school.  Covenant Classical School does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, nationality, or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, and other programs.</span></span></span></span>
