# Mathematics and Science

<span>**<span>Mathematics</span>**</span> <span>Through the study of Mathematics, students see the order, precision, and consistency of God's creation. They come to understand the immutability of God through the fascinating immutability of the number systems.  Students learn how to reason logically and stick with a problem until it is solved, from kindergarten addition to senior calculus.

In the early years, manipulatives are used extensively to ensure that students understand mathematical concepts.  Students then begin to memorize and master basic mathematical facts.  Both conceptual and practical understanding of mathematics is emphasized through the frequent use of word problems.

Students in the Logic School complete Algebra in 8th grade.  Students in the Rhetoric School complete Geometry, Advanced Algebra, and Pre-Calculus, and have the option of taking Calculus in the senior year.</span> <span>**Science**</span> <span>Students explore deeply the physical world God has made and are encouraged to appreciate its awesome beauty and complexity.  Students are given the intellectual tools to understand complex scientific concepts and to pursue scientific careers if they so desire.  They also reflect critically upon the place of science in our society and learn to appreciate that science is a human discipline that has developed over time and is subject to change.

In the Grammar Stage, students develop an understanding of basic scientific terminology, vocabulary, and the scientific method, and enjoy many hands-on experiments.  Students are shown that, because God created the universe, it has inherent order which makes it possible to hypothesize and experiment, as well as to identify, classify, and categorize elements of Creation.  As studies progress, students learn to differentiate between theory and fact.  They become familiar with major scientists in history and their contributions and discoveries. Students develop an increased appreciation for God's perfect design in nature and the universe, and man's stewardship of the earth.</span> ![](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/uploads/scienceandmath-W.jpg)
