[Covenant Classical School Kindergarten](https://vimeo.com/138645506) from [Covenant Classical School](https://vimeo.com/covenantclassical) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) .

Our goal is for your child to love learning from the first day of school.  At Covenant, Kindergarten introduces your child to classroom learning as the first stage of classical Christian education.  Bible, reading, and math form the core of the Kindergarten curriculum.  We use a phonics-based approach to reading which is foundational for long term success in reading development. Equal emphasis is given to mathematics, with students learning addition and subtraction, shapes, time, temperature, and other foundational mathematical skills.  Both the reading and math curricula incorporate a multi-sensory approach.  Songs with motions help to further engage students and reinforce learning.  Additional studies in science, history, geography, music, art, and physical education are included in the program.

<span>Students are introduced to high quality children's literature in Kindergarten. Teachers read aloud daily to the students, fostering a love for literature and development of listening comprehension skills, which provide the foundation for reading comprehension.  Students narrate, or orally summarize, the stories that they have heard, developing both their listening comprehension and oral language skills. Our Kindergarten teacher provides a safe, peaceful, and joyful classroom atmosphere suitable for this age group.</span>  <span>Kindergarten students will attend five days per week on a full-time basis, Monday through Friday.</span>

<span>Students must have had their fifth birthday by September 1st to apply for Covenant's Kindergarten program.  Kindergarten students also need to complete a school readiness screening as part of the application process. If you are interested in learning more about our Kindergarten program, please [<span>visit an open house</span>](http://www.covenantclassicalschool.org/pages/page.asp?page_id=97830) or contact our school office at (630) 983-7500 or <span>[<span>office@covenantclassicalschool.org</span>](mailto:office@covenantclassicalschool.org) .</span></span>
