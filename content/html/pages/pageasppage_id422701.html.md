# Heart Songs

<span>**<span>My Story</span>**
_By Maria Folda, Covenant Parent_</span> <span>“My God is so big, so strong and so mighty,</span> <span></span> <span>There's nothing my God cannot do!</span> <span></span> <span>The mountains are His, the rivers are His,</span> <span></span> <span>The stars are His handiwork, too.”</span>

<span>My kindergartener Rebekah came home from school the other day singing this song. It must have been stuck in her head, because she sang it over and over again. Amid the sounds of her brothers’ house-shaking wrestling matches, I could hear, “My God is so big, so strong and so mighty!” Surrounded by the noise of TV and toys, I could hear, “There’s nothing my God cannot do.” Amongst all the daily chaos of our little family, I could hear, “The mountains are His, the rivers are His, the stars are His handiwork, too.” It made me smile. And gave me a little moment of peace.</span> <span></span> <span></span> <span>People often ask me why we send our kids to Covenant Classical School. This is why we send them. To hear “My God is so big, so strong and so mighty” ring out in the halls of our home.

We send them to learn who God is, how He loves, and just how big He is. </span> <span>That way, when they grow and face the challenges this world surely will bring, they’ll have that song in their hearts. And they will know deep down that the God who created the mountains, the rivers, and the stars also created them. I pray this will give them some peace, God's peace, in the chaos of life.</span>

<span>As John 16:33 says, “These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</span>
